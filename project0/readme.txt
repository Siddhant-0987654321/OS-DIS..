This is the cse291 project0 of Kaiwen Sun (A53091621).

To test if the project works fine, run ./doAll.sh .

The script works in Ubuntu 14.04 (physical machine).

It is assumed that a docker and a ubuntu image exist in the physical OS.

If everything works fine, the script would echo the number of OK and MISSING
contained in client's log, using either read or green color.

The C code for client and server applications are in folder cater.
